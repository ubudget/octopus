# octopus

General backend component for ubudget business logic.

The overall design and implementation of octopus's user registration and sign in
system is heavily inspired by [Veil](https://github.com/zanderxyz/veil).

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
